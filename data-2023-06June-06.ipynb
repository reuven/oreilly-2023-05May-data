    "Today, we are not going to be using Matplotlib... at least, not directly. Pandas has a plotting interface (i.e., it has methods and options) which are then translated into Matplotlib plots. Using Pandas, we can create plots with Matplotlib, but with a much simpler interface.\n",

    "There are some other libraries that are gaining traction, and also wrap themselves around Matplotlib. One of the best known is Seaborn. You can also look at Plotly, which is (I think) a combination of Matplotlib and JavaScript, for Web pages."
